# CHEX-Core-Hole-Excited-States-Basis-Project

Welcome! Glad to hear that you are interested in learning how to construct Core-hole Excited States Basis sets!

This page is created as an open-source supplementary material for publication XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX. Please kindly cite/credit us if you are using any of the code or data here ：-）


The project is divided into the following folders:

1.Data  (Ground State and Excited State Atomic orbitals calculated with different flavors of DFT; Sample XPS Binding Energy Data） 

2.NIST  (Mol file and SDF file for molecules of interests)'

3.Scripts (Scripts for query molecular information on NIST, scripts for constructing basis set, etc. See usage in example notebooks under Examples)

4.Examples (Tutorial style notebooks with full documentation, can be used as physical chemistry/computational chemistry class materials)

5.Basis Sets (Hats off to the masterminds of quantum chemistry such as Dr. John Slater for his simple and elegant rules for core-hole excited states [ref]; Hats off to 
Dr. Thom Dunning et.al, who constructed the corelation consistent basis sets for ground state calculations [ref], a suite of robust and physically accurate basis sets that are still widely used in the computational chemistry community. The CHEX(core-hole exicted states) basis set is largely inspired from these natural orbital based correlation consistent basis. We have shown that these CHEX basis sets work remarkably well for core-hole excited states Binding Energy (XPS) calculations, and/or core-ionization potentials [ref]. Used together with delta SCF calculation, these basis sets were able to resolve decades of unsatisfactory performances in the literatures, and for the first time provide a computational strategy that's both physically and numerically satisfactory. Try for yourself with your favorite molecules!)

This page would be helpful for quantum chemistry researchers and lecturers alike. Now, enjoy exploring!
